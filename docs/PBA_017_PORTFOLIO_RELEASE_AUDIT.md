# PBA-017A — Release Candidate & Portfolio Audit

## Baseline

- Branch: `main`
- Local and `origin/main`: `a9d546a96278f367457b164d0530227f02c8e578`
- Working tree: clean before the audit.
- Regression: 575 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled, 21 suites.
- Public demo: https://spiritstonesrafa-ux.github.io/Pokedex-BatleArena/

## Public and responsive audit

The public build loaded successfully. Pokédex, Meu Time, Quick Battle entry, and Campaign navigation rendered at 1366×768, 390×844, and 360×700 with no horizontal overflow, broken images, runtime exceptions, or newly observed console errors. This is a representative navigation smoke, not a new end-to-end campaign playthrough.

## Repository and architecture audit

- The repository is clean of tracked editor, log, coverage, and temporary-output artifacts. The `scripts/build-campaign-draft-catalog.js` filename is a source build utility, not generated junk.
- A scan for conventional cloud/API/GitHub/OpenAI/private-key credential signatures found no secret.
- `.gitignore` appropriately excludes editor, Node/build, log, and environment artifacts.
- `docs/battle-architecture.md` accurately documents the Data/API → Domain → Battle Session → Game Engine → Presentation Engine → adapters → UI separation. Its campaign note correctly records reuse of the single engine/session architecture.
- `progress.md` remains useful as an agent-history document, but contains accumulated historical next-phase/status entries that can look contradictory when read as current state. Preserve history; reconcile the active summary in PBA-017B rather than deleting history.

## README and portfolio audit

### What already works

README communicates the DIO origin, JavaScript/HTML/CSS/PokéAPI stack, Team Builder, deterministic Battle Engine/SMART AI, presentation layers, live-demo URL, and a detailed architecture diagram. It also links the architecture document.

### Material gaps

1. **P1 — recruiter-facing status is stale.** The opening status still frames the project primarily as a Pokédex plus 3×3 arena. The roadmap marks PBA-014 and PBA-016 incomplete and labels PBA-017 as automated tests, despite the completed Trainer Profile, Campaign, and performance/accessibility work.
2. **P1 — completed Campaign is underrepresented.** The compact Campaign note omits trainer art, Endgame Trials, Shadow Super Trainer, temporary reinforcements, True Ending, and Shadow procedural boss music. A visitor can reasonably mistake the application for Quick Battle only.
3. **P1 — test execution is not discoverable.** Tests are listed structurally, but no command, suite count, or concise explanation of deterministic engine/campaign coverage is provided.
4. **P2 — site metadata is stale.** `index.html` uses “Pokédex Sensacional | Desafio DIO” and a Pokédex-only description, which does not represent the completed Battle Arena/Campaign portfolio scope.
5. **P2 — no explicit license.** No LICENSE file is present. The project owner must select a license; this audit does not select one.
6. **P2 — no concise Pokémon/PokéAPI fan-project disclaimer or trainer-art ownership note is visible in README.** Add only evidence-based wording; do not make unsupported legal claims or reveal generation prompts.
7. **P2 — README has no curated screenshots or social-preview asset.** Existing PBA-014D evidence screenshots are technical evidence, not portfolio framing. A compact visual gallery and intentional social preview are recommended.
8. **P3 — badges are optional.** A small live-demo or JavaScript badge may be useful only if it remains factual; test-status badges are not recommended without CI.

## Accuracy of existing claims

- Accessibility documentation is broadly accurate when read with PBA-016 evidence: keyboard, dialog/focus, contrast/touch, reduced-motion, and semantic-tree verification are supported. Do not claim real screen-reader certification (`SCREEN_READER_REAL = NOT_AVAILABLE`).
- Performance documentation is accurate: it scopes the 65.7% Campaign Home trainer-art transfer reduction and 99.5% two-card reduction to measured cases, not site-wide speed.
- README's “100%” keyboard/responsiveness wording should be softened or linked to evidence in PBA-017B to avoid overstating the unavailable real-screen-reader audit.

## Release readiness

The public application and its regression suite are release-capable. GitHub Release/tag creation is deferred until the README/status/metadata presentation work and owner license decision are resolved.

- Current versioning: no package version, release tag, or documented version policy.
- Recommended future tag: `v1.0.0` after PBA-017B release-hardening acceptance.
- Browser support wording: modern desktop and mobile browsers supporting ES6+, Fetch, LocalStorage, CSS Grid/Flexbox, and Web Audio API.

## Portfolio narrative

> A DIO Pokédex challenge expanded into a browser-based Pokémon Battle Arena: Team Builder feeds a deterministic battle engine and SMART AI; a separate presentation pipeline composes animations, VFX, audio, and camera; the same session architecture powers an 18-Master Campaign through Shadow Final Stand and True Ending; performance and accessibility were measured and hardened before release.

## Strongest engineering evidence

1. Strict Game Engine versus Presentation Engine separation, with a single battle/session architecture shared by Quick Battle and Campaign.
2. Deterministic battle, AI, presentation, audio, VFX, camera, campaign, and UI regression coverage: 575 passing tests across 21 suites.
3. SMART AI and injected randomness, preserving reproducible tests while keeping runtime tactical decisions.
4. A stateful Campaign with 18 Masters, endgame modes, temporary reinforcements, and final battle reuse rather than a second game engine.
5. Evidence-backed performance and accessibility hardening: WebP card thumbnails, lazy/async delivery, contrast/touch/zoom/reduced-motion, accessible dialogs, and human keyboard verification.

## Prioritized findings

| Priority | Area | Finding | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | — | None | — |
| P1 | README | Stale status/roadmap, understated Campaign, undiscoverable tests | Rewrite recruiter-facing README sections in PBA-017B |
| P2 | Metadata | Pokédex-only title and description | Update title/description in PBA-017B |
| P2 | Legal | License decision and concise fan/PokéAPI/trainer-art attribution absent | Request owner decision; add factual disclaimer after decision |
| P2 | Visual/repo | No portfolio gallery/social preview; progress current-summary ambiguity | Add only curated assets and active summary if approved |
| P3 | README | Badges/version strategy | Keep minimal; tag `v1.0.0` only after release acceptance |

## PBA-017A result and next phase

`REPOSITORY_AUDIT = COMPLETE`.

`README_AUDIT = COMPLETE`.

`DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT = COMPLETE`.

`PUBLIC_DEMO_AUDIT = COMPLETE`.

`REPOSITORY_HYGIENE_AUDIT = COMPLETE`.

`SECRET_SCAN = PASS`.

`BROKEN_LINK_AUDIT = COMPLETE` (no broken repository-relative links found; live public smoke passed).

`RELEASE_READINESS_AUDIT = COMPLETE`.

`FULL_REGRESSION = PASS`.

PBA-017A is complete. **PBA-017B — Portfolio Presentation & Release Hardening** should address the P1 README gaps, P2 metadata, and owner-controlled license/disclaimer decisions without changing gameplay or architecture. PBA-017 itself remains in progress.
## PBA-017B — Portfolio Presentation Hardening

PBA-017B resolved the P1/P2 presentation findings without changing gameplay or runtime logic.

### Resolved findings

- README now identifies the product as **Pokédex Pro + Pokémon Battle Arena**, gives the live demo prominence, preserves DIO attribution, and presents the journey from Pokédex to release candidate.
- The completed Campaign is represented as a first-class feature: 18 Type Masters, custom trainer art, badge/roster progression, four endgame trials, Super Trainer, false ending, Shadow Super Trainer, Shadow Aura, Shadow Final Stand, temporary reinforcements, True Ending, and procedural Shadow boss theme.
- The Testing section documents a validated PowerShell command, the v1.0 release-candidate baseline of 575 pass / 0 fail / 0 cancelled / 21 suites, and coverage areas without making a code-coverage claim.
- The performance section accurately scopes the measured trainer-art delivery reduction, WebP thumbnails, preserved full portraits, and Final Stand validation.
- The accessibility section records keyboard, focus/dialog, semantic, contrast/touch/zoom/reduced-motion evidence and explicitly retains the real-screen-reader limitation.
- HTML metadata now represents the complete product rather than a Pokédex-only challenge.
- A concise factual Pokémon/PokéAPI/fan-project disclaimer and conservative trainer-art note were added. No license, screenshot, social preview, tag, or release was created.
- README links now surface the architecture, Campaign, performance/accessibility, and portfolio-audit documents.

### Status

`README_PORTFOLIO_READINESS = PASS`.

`README_CAMPAIGN_VISIBILITY = PASS`.

`CAMPAIGN_README_COVERAGE = COMPLETE`.

`TEST_COMMAND_DOCUMENTED = YES`.

`TEST_COMMAND_VALIDATED = YES`.

`HTML_TITLE_CURRENT = YES`; `HTML_DESCRIPTION_CURRENT = YES`; `PROJECT_NAMING_CONSISTENT = YES`.

`IP_DISCLAIMER_PRESENT = YES`; `TRAINER_ART_DOCUMENTATION = PASS`.

PBA-017B is complete. PBA-017C is ready for owner-controlled portfolio visuals, social-preview, license, version, and release preparation.
## PBA-017C — Portfolio Visuals & Release Preparation

### Portfolio visuals

Five real desktop screenshots were captured from the public-equivalent application in controlled, non-persistent browser states: Pokédex Pro, Battle Arena, Campaign Masters, Super Trainer, and Shadow Final Stand. They are stored under `docs/images/portfolio/` as WebP and linked from the README with descriptive alt text. A 1280×640 PNG social-preview asset was composed with HTML/CSS from the real Battle and Shadow screenshots; it does not invent product UI or alter original trainer art.

`SOCIAL_PREVIEW_ASSET = READY`.

GitHub’s repository social-preview setting cannot be configured from the repository: `GITHUB_SOCIAL_PREVIEW_CONFIGURED = NO`; owner action is required in repository Settings → Social preview.

### License assessment

Repository content separates into original project source code; Pokémon names, sprites, cries and PokéAPI-derived material; custom trainer artwork made for the project presentation; and third-party fonts/icons delivered by their respective providers. This is not legal advice.

| Option | Scope | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — MIT for original source code only | Original JavaScript, HTML and CSS; third-party/Pokémon material excluded by notice | Recommended if the owner wants ordinary source-code reuse while avoiding an implication of rights over third-party IP |
| B — No explicit software license | Publicly viewable repository without broad reuse permission | Suitable if the owner does not wish to grant reuse permission |
| C — Another standard software license | Only after an owner-specific licensing goal is identified | No evidence supports choosing this automatically |

`RECOMMENDED_LICENSE_OPTION = A — MIT for original source code only, with third-party/IP exclusions in accompanying notices`.

`LICENSE_OWNER_DECISION = REQUIRED`. No LICENSE was created. The existing README disclaimer remains conservative and does not imply rights over Pokémon IP.

### Version and release preparation

`PROPOSED_RELEASE_VERSION = v1.0.0`; `VERSION_APPROPRIATE = YES`; `VERSION_SOURCE = GIT_TAG`; `V1_TAG_EXISTS = NO`.

The public release-notes draft is [PBA_017_V1_RELEASE_NOTES_DRAFT.md](PBA_017_V1_RELEASE_NOTES_DRAFT.md). The future-release checklist is [PBA_017_V1_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](PBA_017_V1_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md). PBA-017D must not create the tag or release until the owner resolves the license decision.

### Status

PBA-017C technical gates are complete: screenshots, README gallery, social-preview asset, license audit/options, v1 notes/checklist, secret scan, links, regression, and public validation. `PBA_017D_BLOCKER = LICENSE_OWNER_DECISION`.
### License owner decision

`LICENSE_OWNER_DECISION = MIT_FOR_ORIGINAL_SOURCE_CODE_ONLY`.

The repository now contains a MIT license scoped expressly to original source code. Pokémon-related material, PokéAPI-sourced material, custom trainer art, visual assets, and other third-party material are excluded unless an explicit notice says otherwise. The README contains a matching scope notice and preserves the existing intellectual-property disclaimer. This resolves the owner-decision blocker; PBA-017D is ready to start but is not started by this change.
### v1.0.0 final release closure

`GITHUB_SOCIAL_PREVIEW_CONFIGURED = YES` (confirmed by the owner).

`RELEASE_VERSION = v1.0.0`; `V1_TAG = PASS`; `TAG_TARGET_COMMIT = 665e91dd00736e47ba4cd702026862ed7044cb0a`; `TAG_MOVED_AFTER_CREATION = NO`.

The public GitHub Release is [Pokédex Pro + Pokémon Battle Arena v1.0.0](https://github.com/spiritstonesrafa-ux/js-developer-pokedex/releases/tag/v1.0.0). `GITHUB_RELEASE = PASS`; `RELEASE_DRAFT = false`; `RELEASE_PRERELEASE = false`.

`PBA_017D = PASS`; `PBA_017 = PASS`; `CRITICAL_OPEN_ISSUES = 0`; `FINAL_PROJECT_RELEASED = YES`; `PBA_018 = NOT_STARTED`.
